Certainly! Here's a shorter algorithm:

### Algorithm

1. **Initialize**: Start with an empty playlist (`head = NULL`).

2. **Display Menu**:
   - Options: Add Song, Display Playlist, Delete Song, Exit.

3. **Handle Choice**:
   - **Add Song**: 
     - Input song name.
     - Create a node.
     - Add it to the end of the playlist.
   - **Display Playlist**:
     - If empty, print "Playlist is empty."
     - Else, traverse and print song names.
   - **Delete Song**:
     - Input song name.
     - Find and remove the node.
     - Print "Song deleted" or "Song not found."
   - **Exit**: End the program.

4. **Repeat** until Exit is selected.
